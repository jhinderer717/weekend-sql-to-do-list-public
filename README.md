Weekend SQL To Do List

## Description

    My project takes what is in the weekend-to-do-list database and displays it to the DOM. It has a field to add new tasks and a checkbox to input whether or not it is already done. On the list of all tasks in the database, there is a delete button and a button to mark the task complete. Once a task is marked as complete, the row is turned green.
